In this project, I've used intermediate to advanced level SQL queries to explore the employee database of a company.  For demonstration purposes, I created multiple tables, views, triggers, functions and insert multiple records per table.  I've used various SQL techniques such as Joins, Sub-queries, CTEs, Text functions and so on to analyze the data.
